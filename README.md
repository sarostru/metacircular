# metacircular
metacircular evaluator from chapter 4 of sicp

Implemented in racket using a combination of the approach from sicp and the 100 lines interpreter from [Matt Might] (http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/).

Done as part of the Toronto cscabal sicp reading group in 2014.

I did all the rest of the exercises on my ipad using [Lisping] (http://slidetocode.com/lisping), but the metacircular was getting to be a bit much so I switched to Dr. Racket.
